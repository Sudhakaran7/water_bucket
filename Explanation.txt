There are two types of water bucket: type A and type B. Initially we have N ml of each type of water. There are four kinds of operations:
Serve 100 ml of water A and 0 ml of water B
Serve 75 ml of water A and 25 ml of water B
Serve 50 ml of water A and 50 ml of water B
Serve 25 ml of water A and 75 ml of water B
When we serve water, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.  Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume 
of wter is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can.  We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of water.
Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of water B are used first.  
Return the probability that water A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.

Sample input:
50

Sample output:
0.625

Explanation:
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. 
For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. 
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625

Sample input:
100

Sample output:
0.71875
